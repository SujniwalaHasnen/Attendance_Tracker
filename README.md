# Attendance_Tracker
A simple Attendance Tracker built during my vacation as my first project.  It is made completely using HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript without any  database or backend. This project helped me practice and understand the  core concepts of front-end development, UI design, and file-based data handling.
